# Emotion Detector

This repository contains a Python-based Emotion Detector that identifies human emotions from facial expressions in real time or from images. The project leverages the power of the OpenCV library for facial recognition and the DeepFace library for emotion analysis, combining these tools for accurate and efficient emotion detection.

## Features

- Detects emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, fear, and neutrality.
- Supports both real-time emotion detection via webcam and static image analysis.
- Easy to use and customize for various applications such as mood analysis, behavioral studies, and more.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- DeepFace (`deepface`)

Install the required libraries using:
```bash
pip install opencv-python deepface
